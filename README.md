# Router

A light-weight FRP client-side router.

No wizardry, written to be readable and customizable.

### v0.1

Uses native promises.

### v0.2

Uses Rx.js. Everything is now a stream :)


## Docs

	To be written.


## TODO

- Remove entire config file from global state and use only route data (v0.2)
- Add controller logic
- Replace swig with custom templating language.
- Replace reqwest with custom ajax call.


### Shoutout

A shoutout to [Ranger Mauve](https://github.com/RangerMauve) for making it awesome. It should really be under his github.
