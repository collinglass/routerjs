# Router

A light-weight client-side router.

Inspired by [this](http://joakimbeng.eu01.aws.af.cm/a-javascript-router-in-20-lines/) article by [Joakim Bengtson](https://gist.github.com/joakimbeng). 

I started changing it to use the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) and use swig template language and then it turned into a huge learning experience.


A shoutout to [Ranger Mauve](https://github.com/RangerMauve) for making it awesome. It should really should be under his github.
